# Vue TypeScript

Vue 3 + TypeScript + Composition API combined into a simple and small application

## Development

> You must have installed Node and Yarn.

Assuming you have cloned the repo, run `yarn` at root level to install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:LucasLeandro1204/tstest.git
$ cd tstest
$ yarn
```

Now you should be able to start the vue dev server

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

And that's it, now the app should be available at `localhost:3000`
